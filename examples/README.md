# TISA Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use TISA.

## Running the Examples

Make sure you have installed TISA in your environment (see main README).

### Basic Demo

`demo.py` shows a simple usage of the Python API with synthetic data.

```bash
python demo.py
```

It demonstrates:
- Generating synthetic data.
- Computing TISA distance.
- Comparing with Euclidean distance.
- Accessing detailed alignment results.
